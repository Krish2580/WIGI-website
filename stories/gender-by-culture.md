# Gender by culture

This plot shows the number of gendered biographies of men and women in
Wikidata, by *Culture*.

**culture** is determined by using translating ethnic group, place of birth, and
citizenship into 1 of 9 world cultures as per [Inglehart-Welzel map of the
world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglehart%E2%80%93Welzel_cultural_map_of_the_world)
with [Mechanical Turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk).
Then we take the consensus of the three aggregated variables. All aggregation
maps are available for inspection [on
github](https://github.com/notconfusing/WIGI/tree/master/helpers/aggregation_maps).

As of January 2016, only about 65% of biographies, had culture, so this data is
incomplete.
