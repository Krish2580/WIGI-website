# Gender by date of birth and death

This plot shows the Date of Birth (DoB) and Date of Death (DoD) of each
biography in Wikidata, by gender. Non-binary genders, by last count there are 9
nonbinary genders, are displayed in the tables, and  accounted for in the [full
data set](http://wigi.wmflabs.org/snapshot_data/)

The changes show the *change in totals* since last snapshot, for each year.  

As of October 2014, only about 58% and 28% of biographies, had date of birth
and date of death data, respectively, so this data is incomplete.

The following abbreviations have been used in the tables below for conciseness:

* **F** : Female
* **M** : Male
* **NB** : Non Binary
