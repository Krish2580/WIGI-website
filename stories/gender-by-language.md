# Gender by language

This plot shows the top 40 Wikipedia Languages (by number of gendered
biographies), and compares their number of gendered biographies to female
percentage of those biographies. This cutoff is arbitrary for the sake of
clearly visualizing the distribution across major Wikipedia languages. For
a comprehensive coverage, one can fetch the complete data from the [data
repository](http://wigi.wmflabs.org/snapshot_data/newest/).

The changes show the *number of biographies* added and the *female percentage
change* between the two latest snapshots.

As of October 2014 about 99% of biographies were attached to at least one
Wikipedia site, so this data is mostly complete.

**Hover over the language circle to view its details.**
