# Gender by country

This plot shows the percentage of biographies of women by country of birth,
which we call the **WIGI Score**. Country is determined by seeing if the place
of birth is a country, or if it is a city, see if the city has a country
property in Wikidata.

The changes show the change in total biographies, and change in percentage
since the previous snapshot date.

As of January 2016, only about 30% of biographies, had place of birth, so this
data is incomplete.
