<strong>Wi</strong>kipedia <strong>G</strong>ender Indicators (<strong>WIGI</strong>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is an unfortunate but unavoidable fact that encyclopedias always have had a gender bias. One of the dimensions of this bias is the contributorsâ€™ gender distribution (Thomas 1992; Reagle and Rhue 2011). Just as there were very few women authors among contributors to traditional, printed encyclopedias, recent surveys indicate that women constitute only around 13%-16% of Wikipedia contributors, or Wikipedians (Glott, Schmidt, & Ghosh 2010; Hill and Shaw 2013). 

WIGI is a project producing a **open data set** about the
*gender, date of birth, place of birth, ethnicity, occupation*, and *language*
of **biography articles** in all Wikipedias. Our [data
set](http://wigi.wmflabs.org/snapshot_data/) comes from
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), the database the
feeds Wikipedia, and is updated weekly. This site shows a few demonstrations of
what can be done with that information.

This project started as a [personal research
interest](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03086), and is now [funded by a Wikimedia
Foundation
Grant](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IEG/WIGI:_Wikipedia_Gender_Index).
